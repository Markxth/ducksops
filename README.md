This is a prototype app for my TECH 120 class project. The idea behind the web app is implementing an innovative approach of learning cybersecurity for business employees, following a PaaS approach.
It involes a functional backend design and a gamified UI, as the best way to keep non-technical employees interested is by making it all feel like a game, not a task. Psychologically, no one likes enforced rules 
and activities which they do not wish to participate in, even if required. So, to make this important part of the onboarding process easier for both the business and the employee, I decided to gamify the process, 
so as to make it all "fun".
